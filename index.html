            when you use the <link> tag you will want to always add a 'rel' modifier and a 'href' modifier.
             We do this because we want the web browsing engine to know to what relevence is this document,
             and we want to reference the actual code desirerd. TLDR; Telling machine why we want it and where it is.-->
